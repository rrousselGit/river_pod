title: Abort HTTP requests if the user leaves the screen
---

In this article we will see how the different tools offered by [Riverpod], we can
improve the user experience by stopping HTTP requests when the user don't care
about the result anymore.

The behavior we are looking for is as followed:

- When a user enter a specific screen or scroll to a specific widget, an HTTP
  request is triggered to download the informations needed by the UI.

- The user can continue interacting with the UI freely during the download,
  including leaving the page or scrolling further (which hides the widget).

- In the situation where the user leaves the page or the widget becomes hidden,
  we will want to stop the HTTP requests associated with that widget.

- If the user re-opens the page, the HTTP request should be triggered once again,
  **unless** the request managed to complete previously, in which case we just
  show the previously obtained result.

This should allow users with a slow connection to obtain what truly matters to
them faster.

## Real-world example: Fetching a user from its user ID

Now that we've seen how to use a family, let's make a real-world example.  
In this example, we will use a [FutureProviderFamily] to fetch users from their ID.

First, let's start with creating a [FutureProviderFamily] that receives the user ID
as parameter:

```dart
final userProvider = FutureProviderFamily<User, int>((ref, userID) async {
  // TODO
});
```

Nothing special here. We've specified the type of the object created and the type
of the parameter.

Then, we will want to connect our provider with another provider that exposes a
`UserRepository` object, which is what will allow us to do the HTTP request to obtain
a user:

```dart {8}
class UserRepository {
  Future<User> fetchUser(int userID) { ... }
}

final userRepositoryProvider = Provider<UserRepository>((ref) => UserRepository());

final userProvider = FutureProviderFamily<User, int>((ref, userID) async {
  final userRepository = ref.read(userRepositoryProvider);
  // TODO
});
```

Now, we both have access to the user ID and the class needed to fetch a user.
So we can combine both to perform our HTTP request:

```dart {5}
// ...

final userProvider = FutureProviderFamily<User, int>((ref, userID) async {
  final userRepository = ref.read(userRepositoryProvider);
  return userRepository.fetchUser(userID);
});
```

Finally, we can read the user details in our UI:

```dart {24}
/// A page that shows the list of users
class UserList extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // All the user IDs. It would typically come from another provider
    final userIDs = [1, 2, 3];

    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: userIDs.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        return UserItem(userId: userIDs[index]);
      },
    );
  }
}

class UserItem extends HookWidget {
  const UserItem({Key key, this.userId}) : super(key: key);

  final int userId;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    /// read the user based on its user ID
    final user = useProvider(userProvider(userId));

    return user.when(
      data: (data) => Text('User ${user.name}'),
      loading: () => const CircularProgressIndicator(),
      error: (err, stack) => const Text('error'),
    );
  }
}
```

Doing this has multiple benefits:

- Users are fetched only when needed.  
  This starts downloading the user details only when the UI needs it.

- Users are fetched in parallel, and only the widgets that depend on a user
  are updated when that user is obtained.

- This automatically support cases when the user ID passed to a widget changes.  
  If the user ID changes, the widget will automatically show the new user.
  Furthermore, if the new user was already fetched, this will not trigger a new download

- We now have a single source of truth for reading user details.

- Our `userProvider` can be easily expanded to cancel HTTP requests if the UI
  stops listening to the user before the request was completed.
