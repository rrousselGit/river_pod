title: Reading a provider
---

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

In the [previous article](./provider), we talked about what is a "provider"
and how to create one.  
Now, we will see how to read a provider

For this, we will implement a simple "counter" application.
As a first step, let's create a "counter" provider using [StateProvider]:

:::info
[StateProvider] is a provider that creates an initial value and allow the
application to change that value, which will cause objects listening to our
provider to update.
:::

In our case, we are making a counter, so we want to create an `int` and initialize
it at `0`. This is done like so:

```dart
final counterProvider = StateProvider((ref) => 0);
```

:::caution
Before continuing, make sure that you've added [ProviderScope] at the root
of your Flutter application:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(ProviderScope(child: MyApp()));
}
```

:::

## Consuming a provider

Now that we've both created our provider and added [ProviderScope] in our
application, we can start building our counter.

From there, there are two possibilities:

- You are using [flutter_hooks]/[hooks_riverpod], in which case you can use both
  [useProvider] and [Consumer].
- You are using [flutter_riverpod], in which case you can only use [Consumer].

Let's start with [Consumer], which works in both situations.

### Consumer

[Consumer] is a widget that allows you to listen to a provider.
It works similarly to [StreamBuilder], with a slightly different syntax.

Long story short, to listen to our `counterProvider` we created previously,
we would do:

```dart {8}
class Home extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Counter example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Consumer((context, watch) {
          final count = watch(counterProvider).state;
          return Text('$count');
        }),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example will make our UI listen to `counterProvider` and rebuild a [Text]
(and only that [Text]) when the counter changes.

Notice how the value of `counterProvider` is obtained by a function called `watch`.  
This function is what makes [Consumer] listen to our provider and rebuild
when the value exposed changed.

The interesting part of this syntax is that you can listen to multiple providers
easily, by calling `watch` multiple times:

```dart
final counterProvider = StateProvider((ref) => 0);
final titleProvider = Provider((ref) => 'Hello world');

// ...

Consumer((context, watch) {
  // Listens to both counterProvider and titleProvider at the same time
  final count = watch(counterProvider).state;
  final title = watch(titleProvider);
  return Text('$title: $count');
})
```

:::caution
The `read` method passed as argument of [Consumer] cannot be called asynchronously,
like inside `onPressed` or a [RaisedButton].

If you need to read a provider in response to a user event, see [myProvider.read(BuildContext)](#myproviderreadbuildcontext)
:::


### useProvider (hooks_riverpod only)

If you are using [flutter_hooks]/[hooks_riverpod], an alternative to the previous
syntax is to use [useProvider].

To better understand how it compares to [Consumer], here is a side-by-side
comparison of both:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="useProvider"
  values={[
    { label: 'useProvider', value: 'useProvider', },
    { label: 'Consumer', value: 'Consumer', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="useProvider">

```dart
class Count extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final count = useProvider(counterProvider).state;
    return Text('$count');
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Consumer">

```dart
class Count extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Consumer((context, watch) {
      final count = watch(counterProvider).state;
      return Text('$count');
    });
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Both snippets behave the same: They build a [Text] that changes when the counter
updates.  
But [useProvider] offers a slightly simplified syntax.

Similarly to [Consumer]'s `watch` function, [useProvider] can be used multiple
times in a widget:

```dart
final counterProvider = StateProvider((ref) => 0);
final titleProvider = Provider((ref) => 'Hello world');

// ...

class Count extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final count = useProvider(counterProvider).state;
    final title = useProvider(titleProvider);
    return Text('$title: $count');
  }
}
```

### myProvider.read(BuildContext)

With [Consumer] and [useProvider], we've seen two ways to _listen_ to a provider.

But in some situations, there's no value in listening to the object. For example,
we may need the object only for the `onTap` of a [RaisedButton].

We _could_ use [useProvider]/[Consumer]:

```dart {4,6}
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Consumer((context, watch) {
    final counter = watch(counterProvider);
    return RaisedButton(
      onPressed: () => counter.state++;
      child: Text('increment'),
    )
  });
}
```

But that is not efficient. This would cause the [RaisedButton] to rebuild when
the counter changes, even when the value isn't actually used to _build_ the [RaisedButton].

That's where `myProvider.read(BuildContext)` becomes a solution.

Using it, we could refactor our previous code to:

```dart {4}
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return RaisedButton(
    onPressed: () => counterProvider.read(context).state++,
    child: Text('increment'),
  );
}
```

By doing so, clicking on our button still increments the counter. But the
[RaisedButton] no-longer unnecessarily rebuild when the counter changes.

> I don't see the `read` method on my provider, why is that?

Multiple reasons that can explain why you don't see the `read` method
on your provider:

- You imported `package:riverpod` instead of either `package:flutter_riverpod`
  or `package:hooks_riverpod`.  
  The `read` method is added using extension methods, defined in [flutter_riverpod].
  As such, if you do not import the Flutter/hooks variant, you won't see the `read` method.

- Your provider uses the `.autoDispose` modified (such as `Provider.autoDispose(...)`)
  or a is [Computed].  
  These providers do not support the `read` method and can only be listened.  
  This is because when the provider is no-longer listened, they will release the
  associated resources.

:::info
Depending on the provider that you are listening to, you may not need to do this.  
For example, [StateNotifierProvider] has a built-in way obtain a [StateNotifier]
without listening to its state:

```dart
class Counter extends StateNotifier<int> {
  Counter(): super(0);

  void increment() => state++;
}

final counterProvider = StateNotifierProvider((ref) => Counter());

// ...

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  // Obtains Counter without listening to its state.
  // Will not cause the button to rebuild when the counter changes.
  final Counter counter = useProvider(counterProvider);

  return RaisedButton(
    onPressed: () => counter.increment(),
    child: Text('increment'),
  );
}
```

:::

:::caution
The `read` method **cannot** be called inside the `build` method of a widget.  
If you want to optimize rebuilds, instead use [Computed].

## Wrapping up: A full counter example

Now that we've seen a few way to use our providers inside a Flutter application,
let's finish our counter example.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="hooks_riverpod"
  values={[
    { label: 'hooks_riverpod', value: 'hooks_riverpod', },
    { label: 'flutter_riverpod', value: 'flutter_riverpod', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="hooks_riverpod">

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hooks_riverpod/hooks_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    // Enables Riverpod for the project
    ProviderScope(
      child: MaterialApp(home: Home()),
    ),
  );
}

/// Our counter, which can be accessed anywhere in the application
final counterProvider = StateProvider((ref) => 0);

class Home extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Counter example')),
      body: Center(
        // We've extracted the counter as a separate widget
        // for readability and performance. This is optional
        child: Counter(),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        // No need to rebuild the floating button when the counter
        // changes, so we use "read"
        onPressed: () => counterProvider.read(context).state++,
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class Counter extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final count = useProvider(counterProvider).state;
    return Text('$count');
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="flutter_riverpod">

```dart

void main() {
  runApp(

      child: MaterialApp(home: Home()),
    ),
  );
}

/// Our counter, which can be accessed anywhere in the application
final counterProvider = StateProvider((ref) => 0);

class Home extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Counter example')),
      body: Center(
        // Rebuild only the Text when the counter changes
        child: Consumer((context, watch) {
          final count = watch(counterProvider).state;
          return Text('$count');
        }),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        // No need to rebuild the floating button when the counter
        // changes, so we use "read"
        onPressed: () => counterProvider.read(context).state++,
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
