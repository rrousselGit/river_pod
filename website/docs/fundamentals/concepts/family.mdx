Before reading this, consider reading about [providers](./provider) and [how to read them](./reading).

In this part, we will talk about the concept of "families".

## Why use Families

A family represents not one provider, but a group of providers. Their main
purpose is to offer a way for the UI to pass parameters to providers.

A real-world use-case would be a provider that exposes a user details on a chat
application.  
In a chat application, we have multiple users. As such, a single provider
is not enough to represent all the users.  
Instead, we'd need one provider per unique user.

Families allow doing exactly that.  
A family is a way to create multiple providers based on external values, such as
the ID of a user.

## Creating a family

The syntax for a family depends on what kind of provider you want to create.

As an example, consider a simple [Provider] usage:

```dart
final myProvider = Provider<String>((ref) => 'Hello world');
```

To create a family of [Provider], we would instead write:

```dart
final myFamily = ProviderFamily<String, int>((ref, int parameter) {
  return 'Hello $parameter';
});
```

Notice how similar the structure of both codes is.  
A family is but a variant of a provider, that adds an extra parameter to the
function that creates our value.

The difference between a provider and its family variant is the same for all providers.
Here's another example with [Computed]:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ComputedFamily"
  values={[
    { label: 'ComputedFamily', value: 'ComputedFamily', },
    { label: 'Computed', value: 'Computed', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="ComputedFamily">

```dart
final myComputedFamily = ComputedFamily<Result, Parameter>((watch, parameter) {
  // TODO: somehow use `parameter`
  return Result();
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Computed">

```dart
final myComputed = Computed((watch) {
  return Result();
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Reading a family

Now that we've seen how to create a family, let's see how to consume them.

Consider a family that creates a localized title for our application:

```dart
final titleProvider = ProviderFamily<String, Locale>((ref, locale) {
  if (locale == const Locale('en')) {
    return 'Hello London';
  } else if (locale == const Locale('fr')) {
    return 'Bonjour Paris';
  } else {
    throw UnsupportedError('Unknown locale $locale');
  }
})
```

In this situation, we will not be able to read our provider the same way than
we did before:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  // Doesn't work, titleProvider is not a provider
  final title = useProvider(titleProvider);
  ...
}
```

The syntax is slightly different. We need to pass a `Locale` to our provider to
be able to read it:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="useProvider"
  values={[
    { label: 'useProvider', value: 'useProvider', },
    { label: 'Consumer', value: 'Consumer', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="useProvider">

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  // First, we obtain the current locale
  final locale = Localizations.localeOf(context);

  // Then, we pass the locale to titleProvider, which can later be used by useProvider
  final title = useProvider(titleProvider(locale));

  // Finally we can freely use the result
  return Text(title);
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Consumer">

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Consumer((context, watch) {
    // First, we obtain the current locale
    final locale = Localizations.localeOf(context);

    // Then, we pass the locale to titleProvider, which can later be used by useProvider
    final title = watch(titleProvider(locale));

    // Finally we can freely use the result
    return Text(title);
  });
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

That's it!

Some notes:

- By doing so, the title will automatically update the locale changes.
- If multiple widgets request the title with the same locale, the title
  will not be unnecessarily recomputed, and both widgets will share the same state.

:::tip
It is possible to listen to a family with different parameters simultaneously.  
For example, we could read both the French and English translation of our title
at the same time:

```dart
final frenchTitle = useProvider(titleProvider(Locale('fr')));
final englishTitle = useProvider(titleProvider(Locale('en')));

return Text('$frenchTitle / $englishTitle'); // Bonjour Paris / Hello London
```

## Parameters restrictions

It is important to note that we cannot pass _anything_ as parameter of a family.

For families to work correctly, it is critical for the parameter passed to
a provider to have a consistent `hashCode` and `==`.

Although not required, ideally the parameter should either be a primitive (bool/int/double/String),
a constant (providers), or an immutable object that override `==` and `hashCode`.

A good rule of thumb is, either the parameter never changes, or it overrides `==`/`hashCode`.

:::danger
Avoid passing complex objects that changes often a parameter of a family.  
Once a family is used with a specific parameter, that parameter will forever
stay in memory.

In most situations (primitives/constants), this is completely fine.  
But for complex objects that change over time, it could lead to memory leaks.
