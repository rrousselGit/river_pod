Before reading this, consider reading about [providers](./provider) and [how to read them](./reading).

In this page, you will find information about [Computed]. [Computed] is similar
but slightly different to providers.  
Instead of _creating_ a state, a [Computed] _transforms_ an existing state and
caches the result.

[Computed] is generally used as a performance optimization.  
There are two main reasons why you would want to use [Computed]:

- You want to optimize the number of rebuilds made by your UI.  
  [Computed] can help you with that by allowing widgets to listen to only what
  they need.
- You have an expensive operation (like the UI sorting a list) that you
  don't want to re-execute all the time.

It is generally a good practice to extract state transformations made in the
"build" method into a [Computed].

## How to use Computed

The way [Computed] works is a mix between providers and [Consumer].

First, we will need one or more providers that computed can use. For example,
we could have two states that describe a user: a first name and their last name.

```dart
final firstNameProvider = StateProvider((ref) => 'Mona');
final lastNameProvider = StateProvider((ref) => 'Lisa');
```

From there, we could use [Computed] to compute the initials of that person:

```dart
final initialsProvider = Computed((watch) {
  final firstName = watch(firstNameProvider).state;
  final lastName = watch(lastNameProvider).state;

  return '${firstName[0]}${lastName[0]}';
});
```

This creates a derived state that depends on both the first name and last name.
When either the first or last name changes, the initials will be recomputed automatically.

We can then consume that state like a normal provider inside our widgets:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="useProvider"
  values={[
    { label: 'useProvider', value: 'useProvider', },
    { label: 'Consumer', value: 'Consumer', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="useProvider">

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final initials = useProvider(initialsProvider);
  return Text(initials);
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Consumer">

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Consumer((context, watch) {
    final initials = watch(initialsProvider);
    return Text(initials);
  });
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This has a few interesting consequences:

- This optimizes widget rebuilds.  
  If the first name is changed from "John" to "Joe", then while the name changed,
  the initials didn't.  
  By using [Computed], widgets that use the initials will _not_ rebuild in that situation.


- The [Computed] will not be re-evaluated until one of the values it depends on changes.  
  Even if two or more widgets are listening to the initials simultaneously, the [Computed]
  is evaluated only once.

- If both the first name and the last name change within the same frame, this will
  not pointlessly re-evaluate the [Computed] multiple times.  
  [Computed] will be evaluated only once, the next time the UI tries to read the value.

- If no widget is listening to the initials, the [Computed] is not evaluated at all.

This makes [Computed] really efficient.

:::note
A [Computed] can depend on another [Computed], without losing any of the previously
mentioned benefits.
