title: Providers
---

In the [previous article](./getting_started), we saw how to install [Riverpod]
and make a simple "Hello world".

This time, we will do a deep dive on what "providers" are, and how to use them.

## What is a provider

Providers are the most important components of [Riverpod]. In short, you can think
of providers as an access point to a _shared state_.

Providers solve the following problems:

- Providers have the flexibility of global variables, without their downsides.  
  **Providers do not involve any global state**. Similarly, they can easily be replaced
  with a different implementation for a part of the application (either for testing
  or customization).

* Providers are safe to use.  
  As opposed to most existing solutions, using a provider, it is not possible to
  read a value in an uninitialized state.
  If we can write the code to read a state, that state is available and ready.
  Even if loaded asynchronously.

* Providers allow easily and efficiently listening to a piece of state.  
  They can be accessed in a single line of code, and offers many way to optimize
  your application.

If you are familiar with the concept, you can think of providers as Dart's [Zone](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/Zone-class.html),
but for state-management.  
While most providers will be shared with the entire application, it is entirely
feasible to override the behavior of a provider for one specific function/widget.

## Creating a provider

Providers come in many variants, but they all work the same way.

The most common usage is to declare them as global variables like so:

```dart
final myProvider = Provider((ref) {
  return MyValue();
});
```

:::note
You do not have to declare providers as globals. It is simply usually the most
logical choice.
:::

This snippet consist of three components:

- `final myProvider`, the declaration of a variable.  
  This variable is what we will use in the future to read the state of our provider.
  It should always be immutable.

- `Provider`, the provider that we decided to use.  
  [Provider] is the most basic of all providers. It exposes an object that never
  changes.  
  We could replace [Provider] with other providers like [StreamProvider] or
  [StateNotifierProvider], to change how the value is interacted with.

- A function that creates the shared state.  
  That function will always receive an object called `ref` as a parameter. This object
  allows us to read other providers or to perform some operations when the state
  of our provider will be destroyed.

The type of the object created by the function passed to a provider depends on
the provider used.  
For example, the function of a [Provider] can create any object.
On the other hand, [StreamProvider]'s callback will be expected to return a [Stream].

:::info
You can declare as many providers as you, want without limitations.  
As opposed to when using `package:provider`, in [Riverpod] we can have two
providers expose a state of the same "type":

```dart
final cityProvider = Provider((ref) => 'London');
final countryProvider = Provider((ref) => 'England');
```

The fact that both providers creates a `String` does not cause conflicts. We will be
able to read both values independently from each other without issue.
:::

:::caution
For providers to work, you have to add [ProviderScope] at the root of your
Flutter applications:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(ProviderScope(child: MyApp()));
}
```

## Combining providers

We've previously seen how to create a simple provider. But the reality is,
in many situation a provider will want to read the state of another provider.

To do that, we can use the `ref` object passed to the callback of our provider,
and use its `read` method.

As an example, consider the following provider:

```dart
final cityProvider = Provider((ref) => 'London');
```

We can now create another provider that will consume our `cityProvider`:

```dart
final weatherProvider = FutureProvider((ref) async {
  // We use `ref.read` to read another provider, and we pass it the provider
  // that we want to consume. Here: cityProvider
  final city = ref.read(cityProvider);

  // We can then use the result to do something based on the value of `cityProvider`.
  return fetchWeather(city: city);
});
```

That's it. We've created a provider that depends on another provider.

### Creating an object that depends on a lot of providers.

Sometimes, we may want to create an object that depends on a lot of providers
like so:

```dart
final cityProvider = Provider((ref) => 'London');
final countryProvider = Provider((ref) => 'England');

final weatherProvider = Provider((ref) {
  final city = ref.read(cityProvider);
  final country = ref.read(countryProvider);

  return Location(city: city, country: country);
});

class Location {
  Location({this.city, this.country});

  final String city;
  final String country;

  String get label => '$city ($country)';
}
```

This can quickly become tedious.

In that situation, it may be reasonable to pass the `ref` variable to our
object directly:

```dart
final cityProvider = Provider((ref) => 'London');
final countryProvider = Provider((ref) => 'England');

final weatherProvider = Provider((ref) {
  // Pass the `ref` object to our `Location` class.
  // `Location` will then be able to call `ref.read` to read the providers.
  return Location(ref);
});

class Location {
  Location(this._ref);

  final ProviderReference _ref;

  String get label {
    final city = _ref.read(cityProvider);
    final country = _ref.read(countryProvider);
    return '$city ($country)';
  }
}
```

This avoids having to implement a constructor, which makes changes on the object
easier.

This is fine as, as opposed to `BuildContext` from Flutter, that `ref` object
is completely independent from Flutter/the UI.  
As such the object can still be shared and tested.

## Disposing the resources the state is destroyed

During the lifetime of an application, the state associated with a provider may
get destroyed.  
In this situation, we may want to perform a clean-up before the state destruction.

This is done by using the `ref` object that is passed to the callback of all providers.

That `ref` object expose an `onDispose` method, which can be used to listen to
the state destruction even to perform some task.

The following example uses `ref.onDispose` to close a `StreamController`:

```dart
final example = StreamProvider((ref) {
  final streamController = StreamController<int>();

  ref.onDispose(() {
    // Closes the StreamController when the state of this provider is destroyed.
    streamController.close();
  });

  return streamController.stream;
});
```

:::note
Depending on the provider used, it may already take care of the clean-up process.  
For example, [StateNotifierProvider] will call the `dispose` method of a `StateNotifier`.
